Welcome to our DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) Final Project presentation! In this video, we showcase our DDoS Attacking System, developed with a strong focus on technical depth and real-world application. The project was primarily built using C++ for the core system logic, with a touch of HTML used to host the interface on the web. Throughout the video, we explain the main features, system architecture, and the complete tech stack that made this project possible. Our aim was to create a technically sound, efficient, and fully functional system that reflects our understanding of algorithm design and performance optimization. 

This project was a collaborative effort by:
Muhammad Hassan and Muhammad Musadiq.

Tech Stack Used:

-> C++
-> HTML
